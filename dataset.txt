ME:  Imitation Learning (Learning from an "Oracle")



I will implement this. I plan to develop the expert dataset as follows. For each DAG and setup, I will run the Heft algorithm once and the QL-HEFT algorithm about 10 times. I will keep track of the minimum makespan and the list schedule that got me there. Using this I will generate the expert dataset.

The teacher: 

That is an excellent and highly pragmatic plan for getting started. You have correctly identified the most critical part of an Imitation Learning project: **creating the "expert" dataset.**

Your approach is a very intelligent way to bootstrap the process. Let's break down the implications of this strategy and then outline a "gold standard" workflow that incorporates your idea as a foundational step.

### Analysis of Your Proposed "Oracle"

What you are proposing is to create a "best-of-heuristics" oracle. This is a fantastic starting point.

**Advantages of Your Approach:**

1.  **Feasibility:** It is 100% achievable. You don't need to implement a complex, computationally expensive optimal solver like an ILP. You can get a dataset generated very quickly.
2.  **Performance Baseline:** The schedules in your dataset will, by definition, be better than or equal to what standard HEFT can produce. Therefore, a model trained on this data should also perform better than standard HEFT.
3.  **Excellent for a Prototype:** This method will allow you to build and test your entire end-to-end pipeline (data generation -> feature extraction -> model training -> inference) without getting bogged down by the "perfect oracle" problem.

**The Critical Consideration: The "Sub-Optimal Ceiling"**

The most important thing to be aware of is that the performance of your final trained model is **capped by the quality of your expert**.

* Since HEFT and QL-HEFT are both heuristics (not optimal solvers), the "best" schedule they find is still likely **sub-optimal**.
* Your machine learning model will learn to faithfully imitate this slightly-better-than-HEFT policy. It will learn the patterns that lead to these good-but-not-perfect schedules.
* **The model can never surpass its teacher.** It will never discover a scheduling strategy that is fundamentally better than the best of what HEFT and QL-HEFT can produce.

Think of it like learning to drive. If your expert is a very good, experienced family driver (HEFT/QL-HEFT), you will become a very good driver. But you will never learn the precision cornering and braking techniques of a professional Formula 1 champion (an optimal solver) just by watching your family driver.

### A Proposed "Gold Standard" Workflow for Your Project

I strongly recommend you adopt your plan as **Phase 1** of a more comprehensive strategy. This will make your project much more powerful and academically robust.

#### **Step 1: Build Your "Heuristic Oracle" (Your Current Plan)**

This is your baseline.

* **Action:** Follow your plan exactly. Generate a large dataset where the "expert" schedule for each DAG is the one with the minimum makespan from 1 HEFT run and 10 QL-HEFT runs.
* **Dataset Name:** Let's call this `Dataset_V1`.
* **Model Name:** Train a classifier on this dataset. This will be `Model_V1`.
* **Outcome:** You will have a fast, learned scheduler that performs (on average) better than standard HEFT. This is already a great result.

#### **Step 2: Build a True "Optimal Oracle" (The Upgrade)**

For smaller DAGs, it is computationally feasible to find the **truly optimal schedule**. This is your Formula 1 champion. The standard tool for this is an **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** solver.

* **Action:**
    1.  Model the scheduling problem as an ILP.
        * **Variables:** The start time of each task on each processor (`start_time_i,k`).
        * **Objective:** Minimize the finish time of the exit task.
        * **Constraints:**
            * Dependency constraints (a task cannot start until its parents are finished and data is transferred).
            * Processor constraints (a processor cannot run two tasks at the same time).
    2.  Use a solver (like the open-source **PuLP** in Python, or commercial solvers like **Gurobi/CPLEX**) to find the optimal schedule for small-to-medium DAGs (e.g., up to 20-30 tasks). This will be very slow, but it provides perfect data.

* **Dataset Name:** Generate `Dataset_V2` using only the optimal schedules from the ILP solver.

#### **Step 3: Train, Compare, and Conquer**

Now you have two datasets and can produce two models.

1.  **Train `Model_V2`:** Train a new classifier on your smaller, but perfect, `Dataset_V2`.
2.  **Benchmark Everything:** This is the most important part of your research. Take a new, unseen set of test DAGs (of varying sizes) and compare the makespans produced by:
    * Standard HEFT
    * The best of your 10 QL-HEFT runs
    * Your `Model_V1` (trained on the heuristic oracle)
    * Your `Model_V2` (trained on the optimal oracle)
    * The ILP Solver itself (on small DAGs where it can finish)

### Your Final Implementation Plan

This leads to a clear, powerful project plan:

1.  **Implement the Simulators:** Create a robust C/C++/Python environment where you can run HEFT and QL-HEFT on any given DAG.
2.  **Build the Data Pipeline:** Write the scripts to automate your "Heuristic Oracle" process. This will generate your `Dataset_V1`.
3.  **Train Model V1:** Use this dataset to train your first imitation learning model. You now have a complete, working prototype that already improves on the baseline.
4.  **Implement the Optimal Oracle:** As a next step, implement the ILP formulation for the scheduling problem. This is a significant but well-documented task.
5.  **Generate and Train with Optimal Data:** Use the ILP solver to generate `Dataset_V2` for smaller DAGs and train `Model_V2`.
6.  **Analyze and Conclude:** Run your final benchmark. Your results will likely show that `Model_V2` outperforms `Model_V1`, especially in its ability to make non-obvious choices that lead to better schedules, proving the value of learning from a truly optimal expert.

Your plan is an excellent starting point. By framing it as the first step in this larger workflow, you create a path to a much more impactful and insightful project.
